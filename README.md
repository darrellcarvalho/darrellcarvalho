## About Me
My name is Darrell Carvalho. I am a broadly trained Geographer completing my graduate studies. I have a deep passion for all things geospatial, with a special focus on urban transportation, geodemographics, and open data.

My favorite change to Python is the introduction of `f"strings"` in Python 3.6+; for the uninitiated, it created a much simpler and syntax for inserting values stored in variables into string literals:
```python
w = "World!" # we store an item in a variable
print(f"Hello, {w}") # returns "Hello, World!" by inserting the w variable into the string
```
